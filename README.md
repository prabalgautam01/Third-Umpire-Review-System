# Third-Umpire-Review-System
# Introduction
One of the most treasured memories of growing up is playing cricket with friends. Just like me, there are countless other people whose favourite part of the day is to grab a pair of bat and ball and just play. Gully cricket is the most popular form of sport, is played in everywhere. So, this project going to be very helpful for those cricket fans who want to create their own decision review system. 
The third empire takes the decision about no-ball, runout, or catch out. Here we are going to make the decision review system using python which will take an accurate decision about whether the batsman is out or not out.
# How to Run
Just run the Third_Umpire_Review_System.ipynb file and add the files to your folder:-
